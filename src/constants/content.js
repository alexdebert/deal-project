export const SUMMARY_FIRST_PARAGRAPH = `Spending a weekend in Las Vegas is stressful. Sprawling hotels, casinos, restaurants, shows — can you really see it all in just 48 hours? Night or day, there's always something to do in the Entertainment Capital of the World. From the bright lights of the Strip to the buzz of Fremont Street, this 24-hour desert metropolis will leave you speechless.`
export const SUMMARY_SECOND_PARAGRAPH = `Sin City is your city — a place where anything goes. Want world-class steak at 4 a.m.? You'll find it here. Fancy a game of golf? There are 37 courses to choose from. In fact, there's so much going on here, you'll need another vacation to recover from this one. Phew! Try to relax, though — these tips will provide you with helpful hints on how to take the stress out of your Vegas vacation.`

//Need To Know component
export const NEED_TO_KNOW_TITLE = `What Do I Need to Know Before I Even Arrive in Vegas?`
export const NEED_TO_KNOW_FIRST_PARAGRAPH = `Dates matter. If there's a big conference in town, expect to pay big bucks for your hotel room. Here's a tip: Don't book your trip for the 4th July, Memorial Day weekend or the days leading up to the Super Bowl. Everything's way more expensive!`
export const NEED_TO_KNOW_SECOND_PARAGRAPH = `Never wait in lines. All the clubs in Vegas have different lines depending on whether you have general admission or VIP tickets. Sometimes, you can wait over an hour to get into a club if you have a table reservation, or more than two hours if you're on the guest list. Here at Deal, we'll meet you at the club and walk you right in. That means no more waiting!`
export const NEED_TO_KNOW_THIRD_PARAGRAPH = `If you came together, stay together. Never book a room at a different hotel to your friends or family. It makes more sense to share rooms at a decent hotel than book separate rooms at a crummy one. Looking for the best Vegas deals? We can negotiate room rates for you.`

//Where to stay component
export const STAY_TITLE = `There are 124,270 Hotel Rooms in Vegas. Where Should I Stay?`
export const STAY_FIRST_PARAGRAPH = `Where you stay in Vegas is a gamble. You want to book a hotel that's close to all the clubs, restaurants and shows you plan to visit, and provides you with a great deal. There's nothing worse than traveling an hour — or more!— to get from one place to another on the other end of the Strip.`
export const STAY_SECOND_PARAGRAPH = `Should you book a suite or not? It depends. A significant proportion of suite upgrades just aren't worth it. All you really get is a slightly larger room. Yes, some of the specialty suites are amazing (they have huge areas where you and your guests can chill) but, unfortunately, they come with a huge price tag. These rooms are negotiable, but there's no guarantee you'll get a good price.`

//Clubs and Pool parties component
export const CLUB_POOL_TITLE = `What About Clubs and Pool Parties?`
export const CLUB_POOL_FIRST_PARAGRAPH = `The best tables at the best clubs on the best nights are hard to find. (It's even harder to find a good deal!) Luckily, we can find you the greatest seats in town.`
export const CLUB_POOL_TIPS = `Here are some more tips:`
export const CLUB_POOL_ITEM_1 = `It's cheaper to book a table at a good club on nights when they don't host major DJs.`
export const CLUB_POOL_ITEM_2 = `Regardless of the night of the week, table location makes all the difference. Tables close to the main dance floor are always the most expensive, but you can get tables on upper dance floors that are just as fun.`
export const CLUB_POOL_ITEM_3 = `Remember, clubs have different-sized tables, so make sure there's enough room for all your party guests.`
export const CLUB_POOL_ITEM_4 = `The same rules apply for pool parties. Bear in mind, though, that pools are only open from March through October. Then they close for the winter season.`
export const CLUB_POOL_LAST_PARAGRAPH = `Here at Deal, we can add you to the guest list for certain clubs and pool parties. But, guest list perks — including free admission — are usually just for women.`

//Get Around Vegas component
export const GET_AROUND_TITLE = `OK, That Sounds Good. But How Do I Get Around Vegas?`
export const GET_AROUND_FIRST_PARAGRAPH = `Once you land in Sin City, just use Uber. Pre-arranged transportation is expensive and, in our opinion, it's just not worth it.`
export const GET_AROUND_SECOND_PARAGRAPH = `Limos are fun if you're traveling with a big group (eight or more people). But don't book one of these vehicles for the whole evening. Instead, let your driver just take you from point A to point B — it's cheaper. There are other travel options for large groups, such as buses.`

//Where have dinner component

export const DINNER_FIRST_PARAGRAPH = `Other people booked seats at the best restaurants in Vegas months ago, so avoid disappointment and reserve a table for your weekend right now. Otherwise, you could end up at some pretty mediocre places.`

//What else component
export const WHAT_ELSE_TITLE = `What Else Should I Do?`
export const WHAT_ELSE_FIRST_PARAGRAPH = `There are loads of things to keep you entertained in this town. ATVing, helicopter tours, gun ranges, flying fighter jets — these are some of the activities you can do here.`
export const WHAT_ELSE_SECOND_PARAGRAPH = `Seeing as you're just in town for a short time, don't waste time walking up and down the Strip. Plan where you want to go instead. Oh, and don't hire a car. Yes, it seems like a good idea until you realize that valets take forever to find your vehicle. You can't drive fast in this town, anyway, so if you want to drive, go to the track.`
export const WHAT_ELSE_THIRD_PARAGRAPH = `Finally, don't let taxi drivers take you to strip clubs. They are probably paid by the establishments, and you'll end up spending more money. If you want to visit a strip club, arrange a free limo.`
export const WHAT_ELSE_FOURTH_PARAGRAPH = `Want to take the stress out of your weekend vacation in Vegas? Follow the tips on this page and plan your trip properly so you can have more fun when you get there. Remember, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!`
